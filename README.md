This project was made Jim Shaped Coding's Tutorial on YouTube. You can check his full video by [Clicking This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVv6mJpFOb0&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org).

Please take note that we are going to only use the **main2.py** file for this project. I am going to focus on explaining how I created this web scraping project.
